# NLP EaseSum

NLP EaseSum is a project that utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques to create a text summarization tool. This project focuses on an extractive approach to summarization and is ideal for users looking to quickly extract key information from large textual data.

## Features

- Extractive text summarization using NLP techniques
- Utilizes GloVe embeddings for enhanced summarization accuracy
- Tokenization methods for improved text processing
- Integration with NLTK, RE, and NetworkX libraries
- Seamless integration with Python for easy usage and customization

## How It Works

NLP EaseSum employs a combination of tokenization, GloVe embeddings, and extractive summarization techniques to generate concise summaries from input text. By leveraging NLTK, RE, and NetworkX libraries, the project ensures efficient processing and accurate summarization of textual data.

## Getting Started

To get started with NLP EaseSum, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   
2. Install the required dependencies using pip:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Download the GloVe embeddings from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sawarn69/glove6b100dtxt) and place them in the designated directory.

4. Run the `main.py` script to start using the text summarization tool:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
